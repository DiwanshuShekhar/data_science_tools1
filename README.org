* Course Description
It is recommended that you consult this github page often for material related to this course. You should check your e-mail periodically for messages.
Assignments will be upload here and in the [[https://canvas.du.edu/login/ldap][canvas]].

The main objective of data science tools 1 is to learn various tools to perform data analysis. Focus in tool1 is data cleanup, summarization ,and visualization.
It is more like a hacking skill set but our primary focus will be on the scientific python  and Linux ecosystem. We'll use [[http://jupyter.org/][jupyter notebook/lab]] for in the class and homeworks. This should make our learning interactive.

For the final project, students will work through  individual or team projects applying course-work
to the full data lifecycle within a particular domain. The focus will also be
on best data science/software engineering practices and reproducible work.

*Please select one of the projects by January 20th  as per your preference.* There will be a homework asking about the detail of your final project. We'll provide feedback about feasibility as the final project.


** Syllabus
*This syllabus is subject to change at the discretion of the instructor*.
- Jupyter Notebook for reproducible workflow.
- Data science and EDA.
- Git tools work flow.
- Data science at command prompt. Linux command line, bash,  basic awk and sed.
- Data collection and ingestion(web scrapping and reading datasets + pandas).
- Data cleanup and imputation + Pandas.
- Data summarization and visualization+ panda(groupby, apply, aggregate etc).
- Final projects, Can be based on initial capstone work?
- Go over some some topics as per students demands.
- more to come

 *Linux command line and scientific python ( primarily numpy, matplotlib, request, seaborn, basic pandas) will be used throughout the course.*

* Grading
*There will be a final project and coding/analysis homework assignments. We'll drop one of your worst assignment grade*.

One has to do  a *final project*  to full fill course requirements.
There will be a final presentation of the work done during current quarter.
You will be required to  submit a final report in the jupyter notebook format.

* Software Installation
** Python
We want to have same experience at any part of data science life cycle. Please follow steps as
per your operating system.

Please install [[https://www.anaconda.com/download/][Anaconda for Python 3.7 data science platform]]. Please install Download Anaconda Distribution
*Version 2018.12 | Release Date: December 21, 2018*. Please install it before coming in the class. 
We'll be doing live exercises almost in all the classes.
See the youtube link [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOFONKvaz0A][Installing Anaconda, Jupyter Notebook]]. 

*** Linux and Mac Os installation.
Please choose right operating system from anaconda site.

*** Window based installation
Please install Linux Subsystem on window 10. Follow the instruction in this post [[https://medium.com/hugo-ferreiras-blog/using-windows-subsystem-for-linux-for-data-science-9a8e68d7610c][Using Windows Subsystem for Linux for Data Science]]
by Hugo Ferreira for installing Linux and Anaconda on windows.

Note that we'll be using Version 2018.12 | Release Date: December 21, 2018. When you follow above post please download
Anaconda3-2018.12-Linux-x86_64.sh  using command
*wget https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda3-2018.12-Linux-x86_64.sh* while following *Install Anaconda* section in blog post.


You can also watch this [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cvrqmq9A3tA][video]] to see installation of Windows 10 Bash & Linux Subsystem Setup but you still have to
install Anaconda as mentioned in above blog post.


You can also go to my  [[https://github.com/psnegi/PythonForReproducibleResearch][python for reproducible research]]  github repository and start by running pythonBasic.ipynb notebook.
I will go over basic of python and jupyter notebook.
