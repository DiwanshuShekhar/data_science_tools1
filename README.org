** Optional material

* Course Description
  
*This syllabus is subject to change at the discretion of the instructor*

Main objective of data science tools 1 is to learn various tools to perform data analysis.
It is more like a hacking skill set but our primary focus will be on the scientific python  and Linux eco system. We'll use jupyter notebook/lab for in class and homework. This should make our learning very interactive.

For final project, students will work through  individual or team projects applying course-work
to the full data life cycle within a particular domain. Focus will also be
on best data science/software engineering practices and reproducible work.

*Please select one of the project by January 20th  as per your preference.* There will be a homework asking about detail of your final project and any feedback. Primary focus in tool1 is data cleanup, summarization and visualization.

** Syllabus
- Jupyter Notebook for reproducible workflow.
- Data science and EDA.
- Git tools work flow.
- Data science at command prompt. Linux command line, bash,  basic awk and sed.
- Data collection and ingestion(web scrapping and reading datasets + pandas).
- Data cleanup and imputation + Pandas.
- Data summarization and visualization+ panda(groupby, apply, aggregate etc).
- Final projects, Can be based on initial capstone work?
- Go over some some topics as per students demands.
- more to come

 Scientific python ( primarily numpy, matplotlib, request, seaborn, basic pandas) will be used throughout the course.

* Grading
There will be a final project and coding/analysis homework assignments.

One has to do  a *final project*  to full fill course requirements.
There will be a final presentation of the work done during current quarter.
You will be required to  submit a final report.

* Projects
  You can choose your own dataset.

* Software
** Python
We want to have same experience at any part of data science life cycle. Please follow following step as
per your operating system.

Please install [[https://www.anaconda.com/download/][Anaconda for Python 3.6 data science platform. Please install Download Anaconda Distribution
Version 2018.12 | Release Date: December 21, 2018.  ]]Please install it before coming in the class. 
We'll be doing live excercises.
See the youtube link [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOFONKvaz0A][Installing Anaconda, Jupyter Notebook]]. 

*** Linux and Mac Os installation.
Please choose right OS from anaconda site.

*** Window based installation
Please install Linux Subsystem on window 10. See this video to follow the instruction on installation.

Then follow the instruction in this post [Using Windows Subsystem for Linux for Data Science](https://medium.com/hugo-ferreiras-blog/using-windows-subsystem-for-linux-for-data-science-9a8e68d7610c)
by Hugo Ferreira for installing Linux and Anaconda on windows.

Note that we'll be using Version 2018.12 | Release Date: December 21, 2018. When you follow above post please download
https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda2-2018.12-Linux-x86_64.sh using command

wget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda2-2018.12-Linux-x86_64.sh
while following *Install Anaconda* section.


You can also watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cvrqmq9A3tA) to see installation of Windows 10 Bash & Linux Subsystem Setup but you still have to
install Anaconda as mentioned in above blog post.


You can also go to my  [[https://github.com/psnegi/PythonForReproducibleResearch][python for reproducible research]]  github repository and start by running pythonBasic.ipynb notebook.
I will go over basic of python and jupyter notebook.
