* Course Description
  
*This syllabus is subject to change at the discretion of the instructor*

Main objective of data science tools 1 is to learn various tools to perform data analysis.
It is more like a hacking skill set but we will focus on the scientific python  and Linux eco system. We'll use jupuyter notebook/lab
for in class and homework. This should make our learning very interactive.

For final project, students will work through  individual or team projects applying course-work
to the full data life cycle within a particular domain. Focus will also be
on best data science/software engineering practices and reproducible work.
If you are not working towards your capstone project, *Please select one of the project by January 20th  as per your preference.*
There will be a homework asking about detail of your final project and any feedback.
Primary focus in tool1 is data cleanup, summarization and visualization.

** syllabus
- Jupyter Notebook for reproducible workflow.
- Data science and EDA.
- Git tools work flow.
- Data science at command prompt. Linux command line, bash,  basic awk and sed.
- Scientific python ( primarily numpy, matplotlib, request, seaborn, basic pandas).
- Data collection and ingestion(web scrapping and reading datasets + pandas).
- Data cleanup and imputation + Pandas.
- Data summarization and visualization+ panda(groupby, apply, aggregate etc).
- Final projects, Can be based on initial capstone work?
- Go over some some topics as per students demands.
- more to come

*** Topics

* Grading
There will be a final project and some coding homework assignments.

One has to do  a *final project*  to full fill course requirements.
There will be a final presentation of the work done during current quarter.
You will be required to  submit a final report.

* Software
** Python
Please install [[https://www.anaconda.com/download/][Anaconda for Python 3.6 data science platform. ]]Please install it before coming in the class on Tuesday.
See the youtube link [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOFONKvaz0A][Installing Anaconda, Jupyter Notebook]]. 
You can also go to my  [[https://github.com/psnegi/PythonForReproducibleResearch][python for reproducible research]]  github repository and start by running pythonBasic.ipynb notebook.
I will go over basic of python and jupyter notebook.
